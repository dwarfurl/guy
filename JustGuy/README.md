This is a new "side project" for guy (code named justguy, but perhaps will be "GuyCompo")
Will certainly be a module, on top of guy, to let developp a kind of vuepy/justpy app
(will need a guy >=0.7.1)

At the beginning, it was just a test to try to reproduce (with "Guy"), things like :
- justpy
- https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/gfq5ik/i_wrote_a_new_ui_framework_inspired_by_flutter/
- flutter

But things going better and better ... without too magical things
Helped by the vuejs concepts: it's now a lot more than a toy
And so : it could clearly the future of "Guy Components" ;-)
(a kind of justpy: develop an app (or webapp) with py3, on sside only (no html/js/css))
(which could be a kind of "Vue"/py3 in server side)

need to work on a kind of state manager (flux/reduc/vuex) .. to be ready for prime time
